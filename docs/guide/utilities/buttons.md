# utilities/_buttons.scss

Buttons class are made to be used with `<a>`, `<button>` and `<input>` tags

Each type of buttons is looped over `$user-colors` (from [core/variables.scss](guide/core/variables)) so the generated buttons will depend of your colors array

| class                   | description                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| .button-**{color}**         | classic button with a darken on: hover  |
| .button-outline-**{color}** | outlined button become full on  : hover |
| .button-invert-**{color}**  | the reverse of outlined button          |

!> Note that `{color}` replace every key from `$user-colors`

Buttons are generated with above classes and you can replace "color" with every `$user-colors` key e.g. `.button-secondary` or `.button-lightgrey` etc...

They are also generated with a color contrasted from his background, then if the background is darker, the color will automatically change into white (this behavior comes from [text mixins](guide/mixins/typography.md?id=text-contrast))

## Examples

See below default buttons what is generated by default `$user-colors`

## Sizes

To custom sizing of buttons, you can change the font-size of them because they are made with **em padding**, you can do it manually or use `fs-*` utilities class [from there](guide/utilities/text.md), the buttons will grow with font-size, but you can still want to change padding, same here you can change it manually or use [Spacers](guide/utilities/spacers.md) to custom padding e.g. `px-150`, `py-75` `p-50` etc...

> Note that **spacers** are made with `rem` and so, if you use spacers, the font-size wont influence buttons sizes

## Active and Disable states

Active states (`:active`, `.active`) is actually the same of `:hover` states on every buttons, the disable states are not currently supported

## How to custom

If the default buttons don't fill your needs, you can update a bit by using [utilities class](guide/utilities) to change padding, color, hover color, background color, font-size and more :

```html
<a href="#" class="button-primary px-250 py-75 color-blue hover:color-red fs-18">button</a>
```

You can also use the `%btn` placeholder which set default style for every buttons and create your own :

```scss
%btn {
	padding: .5em 2em;
	text-decoration: none !important;
	user-select: none !important;
	outline: none !important;
	cursor: pointer;
	transition: .4s;
}
```

## Source Code
```scss
%btn {
	display: inline-block;
	padding: .5em 2em;
	text-decoration: none !important;
	user-select: none !important;
	outline: none !important;
	cursor: pointer;
	transition: .4s;
}

// Creates a button with variation of each color in $user-colors
@each $color, $value in $user-colors {
	.button-#{$color} {
		@extend %btn;
		@include button-variant($value);
	}
	
	.button-outline-#{$color} {
		@extend %btn;
		@include button-outline-variant($value);
	}
	
	.button-invert-#{$color} {
		@extend %btn;
		@include button-invert-variant($value);
	}
}
```
